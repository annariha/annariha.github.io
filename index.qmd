::: {#about-block}
:::

I am a doctoral researcher in the [Probabilistic Machine Learning](https://research.cs.aalto.fi/pml/) group at Aalto University supervised by [Aki Vehtari](https://avehtari.github.io/) and [Antti Oulasvirta](http://users.comnet.aalto.fi/oulasvir/). 

My research interests lie in Bayesian data analysis, modelling workflows, iteration in model building and metastatistics. 
I am interested in interdisciplinary perspectives on Bayesian workflows and building bridges between method development and applied research. 

On this website, you will find information about my research projects as well as case studies and a blog with occasional random musings. 
Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions or would like to discuss potential projects.

Before my current position, I completed my MSc in Statistics at Humboldt University Berlin with a [thesis project](https://edoc.hu-berlin.de/handle/18452/22837) on hyperprior sensitivity of wrapped Gaussian processes including an application to wind data, supervised by [Nadja Klein](https://rc-trust.ai/klein/) and [Thomas Kneib](https://www.uni-goettingen.de/de/prof.+dr.+thomas+kneib/264255.html). 
During my studies, I also worked as a research assistant in the group of [Andreas Brandmaier](https://www.mpib-berlin.mpg.de/staff/andreas-brandmaier) in the project "Formal Methods in Lifespan Psychology" at Max Planck Institute for Human Development in Berlin. 
Before, I earned my BSc degree in Economics with a focus on Empirical Economics and a minor in Sociology from University Potsdam where I wrote my Bachelor thesis under the supervision of [Marco Caliendo](https://caliendo.de/).
